# Infix + Posfix Notation
Hey guys!🖐️

This is a Vim Simulator using Java!

Here you have some real functions and some adapted functions from Vim, a famous text editor where you have command lines to edit your files, instead of only writing on it like a NotePad.

I've applied knowledge of:
- Data Structres, such as LinkedList
- Exception Handling
- Basics from Java (loops, conditionals,...)

**I hope you enjoy it!🤟**
